## Why it was made?

I was never good at writing nor I wanted to do so. So why even bother with
personal website (for some reason I like that term better than blog)?
Well... because I can.

Maybe having a place like this will motivate me to work on some of my
side-projects (I will need something to write about, right?). Or maybe it will die like
most of those projects ;) Time will show.

## How it was made?

I've read somewhere that it is a tradition to start a blog with a post
about building the site itself. Not sure if it is a real thing, it was some
random programmer's site (just like this one) and I never bothered to verify that.
Anyway, that will give me some volume for this first entry (though not much

- things are pretty simple nowadays).

This page is git based and built with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
(lookup Jamstack if you are interested in more details).
It uses [nextjs-netlify-blog-template](https://github.com/wutali/nextjs-netlify-blog-template).

The process is as straightforward as possible:

1. Go to [nextjs-netlify-blog-template](https://github.com/wutali/nextjs-netlify-blog-template).
1. Click a "Deploy to Netlify" button (or follow this link directly to Netlify:
   [Deploy](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/wutali/nextjs-netlify-blog-template&stack=cms)).
1. Connect Netlify to GitHub.
1. Provide repository name for the site and click "Save & Deploy" (template
   already configures Identity and Git Gateway services so they will be installed
   automatically).
1. Set up a domain (in my DNS provider configuration I added a `CNAME` record
   with `site` subdomain host and pointed it to my Netlify subdomain).
1. Do some cleanup of a template (remove default posts and tags).

And that is it.

Writing this paragraph took many times longer than it took to go through those
steps.

## Why it was made like that?

Despite working as a developer for quite some time already I had no previous
experience of creating a website all by myself. So my choices might be a little
random and whimsy. Things that led me to this decision (in random order):

- I think that server-side generated static site is a good fit for a personal
  site.
- I like Jamstack idea of git driven CMS (no backend API needed).
- As I work professionally with [Angular](https://angular.io/) lately, I
  decided that [React](https://reactjs.org/) based solution will be nice.
- I read some articles and watched some videos about
  [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and wanted to try it out.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) was my first search result in Google and
  it has a free tier which should fit my needs for now.
- Medium seems like a go-to platform for blogging (or maybe it is not anymore)
  but I wanted a personal site not an account on yet another social... medium.
  Also, I might be adding something more than just blog posts (some online
  utils, apps), and it is nice to have such possibility out of the box.

I am not saying this is a perfect solution. Heck it is probably far from optimal
or state of art. At some point I might change it to something else
(self/cloud-hosted?).

But in the end
